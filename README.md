# German-Credit-Data-Analysis
This project involved analyzing the German Credit dataset to explore patterns in customer credit risk. I used Microsoft Excel to clean and prepare the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency for analysis. Using pivot tables, I identified trends in creditworthiness, loan purposes, and customer demographics. An interactive dashboard was built to visualize key insights, enabling quick and clear interpretation of credit risk distribution. This project demonstrates strong skills in Excel based data analysis, reporting, and financial data visualization.
